# Privacy policy

This is the privacy policy for the Android app "Bluetooth Volume Control" by Matthias Urhahn (darken).

## Preamble

I do not collect, share or sell personal information.

Send a [quick mail](mailto:support@darken.eu) if you have questions.

My underlying privacy principle is the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).

## Automatic crash reports

*This was removed in version v2.57+*

The app uses "Bugsnag" for automatic crash reports:

https://www.bugsnag.com/

Bugsnags privacy policy can be found here:

https://docs.bugsnag.com/legal/privacy-policy/

Crash reports may contain device and app related information.
Personally identifying information is not required to fix bugs and thus not sought by me or the app.

You can disable automatic crash reports in the app's settings.
