Bluetooth Volume Manager can react to Bluetooth devices connecting or disconnecting.
It allows Android to remember the volume levels of different Bluetooth devices.

Available features:

* Music, call, ringtone and notification volume adjustment.
* Sending out 'Play' or 'Next' media commands.
* Opening a specific app.
* Keeping the screen awake.
* Preventing the volume from being changed.
* Restoring previous volume levels after disconnect.

This app can't "boost" your volume or change the volume if you can't change it through your device's volume buttons manually.

Permissions explained:

* 'Internet' for bug reports.
* 'Bluetooth' to work with Bluetooth devices.
* 'Modify audio settings' to change volume.
* 'Boot completed' to restore volume levels after reboots.
* 'WAKE_LOCK' to fix a bug on Samsung devices and to keep the screen awake if necessary.
* 'SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW' to launch apps when a Bluetooth device connects (only on Android 10).
